## Keywords

VerbalExpression only includes a small package of available keywords for regular expression generation.
There are different types of keywords and values. Please see the specific keyword documentation to learn more about the
different value types you can pass and which values are valid.

There are some keywords, which only except a `boolean`, a `string` or a semicolon(;)-separated value to handle `array`-input.
